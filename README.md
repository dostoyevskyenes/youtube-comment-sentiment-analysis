# YouTube Comment Sentiment Analysis

This project performs sentiment analysis on a sample dataset of YouTube video comments using Python. It applies natural language processing (NLP) tools to label each comment as **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral**, and visualizes the results through various charts.

## Project Overview

- **Language:** Python 3.x  
- **Tools & Libraries:**  
  - pandas  
  - TextBlob  
  - matplotlib & seaborn  
  - WordCloud

## Features

- Reads YouTube comments from a CSV file  
- Applies sentiment analysis using TextBlob  
- Categorizes comments into Positive, Negative, and Neutral  
- Generates:
  - Bar chart of sentiment distribution  
  - WordCloud of the most frequent words  
  - Time series plot of comment sentiment by date  
  - Table of longest comments
